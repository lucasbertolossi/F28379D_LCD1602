# F28379D_LCD1602
Make LCD1602 work on TI C2000 Delfino F28379D.
Header file contains the Hardware connection for F28379D and LCD1602.
My LCD1602 is ADM1602K, so I use 5V supply. Different LCD might use 3.3V. Confirm VDD with datasheet.
To use the code, simply include the header file and drag the .c file into the project. 
Or you can download the project name "F28379D_lcd1602" and import it as CCS project.
